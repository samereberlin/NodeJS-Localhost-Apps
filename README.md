# NodeJS Localhost Apps

NodeJS Localhost Apps project is a lightweight and modularized application server, composed by a set of browser based utilities (available via http://localhost:3000) designed to help with daily basis activities (e.g. file manager, text editor, media player/miner, calculator, games, etc.).

## Working in progress

But it is still under development, so please wait for the first official release before start using it :-)
